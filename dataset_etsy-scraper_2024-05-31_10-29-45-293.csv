I actually 'run' a sanctuary for them and I enable their 'activation'... it's like giving them a wake-up call and making sure they are ready to work and facilitate yours and their own purpose. <br>The crystals that are listed in my Etsy shop *byOlgaStar* are very much alive and ready to work:<br><a href=""https://www.etsy.com/uk/shop/byOlgaStar"" target=""_blank"">https://www.etsy.com/uk/shop/byOlgaStar</a><br><br>Trying to charge such special crystals is akin to performing a lobotomy on them 😢<br><br>Now cleansing! ... when crystals travel they may get a bit shaken up. So it would be advisable to take the crystals out of the packaging (very carefully and on top of something safe/soft) and let them rest for a day or two. You can work with them straight away if you feel the crystals are eager to get going!<br>I do 'seal' their energies for the duration of their travel, so most of the crystals you acquire from me should be arriving ready to work :)<br><br>You are welcome to give them a gentle wash (no soap and no salt!) with plain water and only if the listing doesn't state: NO WATER (I have those as well) and then let them dry naturally. You may put them in the sun but for no longer then 5/15 mins as some crystals change colour in the sun or even loose it :( <br><br>No smudging or anything of such sorts required. <br>You can perform it as your own and habitual bonding experience should you absolute unable to control your urge of doing something to the crystals 🙈😛 ... Just saying! ❤️<br>OR! if you have other rituals in store for the new crystals arriving to your very own Crystal Kingdom.<br><br>2) IS THE INFORMATION/DESCRIPTION AVAILABLE AFTER I COMPLETE THE PURCHASE?<br>Once a crystal is 'sold', the information gets deleted. I often have very crystal-specific information within my listings. Meaning that the information is only relevant to that very specific crystal. There is no need for such info to float about.<br>I now try my best to include the crystal's description with the crystal itself (can't always guarantee).<br>I still highly recommend you SAVING THE DESCRIPTION as I delete it the minute I ship the crystal to its new home...<br><br>And remember the crystal healing information provided here is for your guidance only. It is not intended as a substitute for medical advice or service.<br><br>3) WHO ARE STARSEEDS?<br>I have a listing explaining just that:<br><a href=""https://www.etsy.com/uk/listing/728176889"" target=""_blank"">https://www.etsy.com/uk/listing/728176889/who-are-starseeds-by-olga-star-resources</a><br>You do not have to purchase the listing, simply read the description.<br>Otherwise please watch my YouTube Video:<br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFj_-Zv-OZg (please copy and paste the link into your browser)<br><br>4) I AM HIGHLY SENSITIVE EMPATH, CAN YOU HELP?<br>Most of my clients are highly sensitive aware and awakened/awakening empaths. I have a large selection of crystals that are the best suited for highly sensitive empaths as well as info/support listing:<br><a href=""https://www.etsy.com/uk/listing/1542978223/highly-sensitive-empath-purpose-and"" target=""_blank"">https://www.etsy.com/uk/listing/1542978223/highly-sensitive-empath-purpose-and</a><br><br>and for crystals:<br><a href=""https://www.etsy.com/uk/shop/byOlgaStar?search_query=empath"" target=""_blank"">https://www.etsy.com/uk/shop/byOlgaStar?search_query=empath</a><br><br><br>💫 SHIPPING 💫<br><br>All crystals are shipped 'tracked' as a 'small package' and usually in a carton box. This is to ensure their safe journey, which means there is always extra space for more crystals to fit in, and you can add as many crystals as you like for that ONE FREE SHIPPING 'fee' only (with rare exceptions).<br>Do treat yourself to an extra crystal or two :-) 💙<br><br>PLEASE CONTACT ME if you require to arrange an INSURANCE or alternatively you may opt for an express service that is the safest I find when dealing with such precious crystals.<br>Personally I highly recommend the express service that way we don't need to arrange any insurance as I find that's the safest and fastest way to deliver YOUR treasures to you.<br><br>Need to be said... 🙈<br>I ship everything TRACKED, even if you don't purchase (don't pay for) any additional shipping. The tracking number IS in your order.<br>IF YOU DO NOT receive your package WITHIN 1(!) WEEK after I mark 'shipped' (no matter where in the world you are!), please go onto your local post office website and track your package. If at all possible, sign up for the shipping alerts.<br><br>If you want to have your crystal insured, then you need to contact me to set up a custom shipping FEE as insurance costs A LOT EXTRA. <br>Obviously if you insure up to a higher value than the price you have paid, that will have to be reflected on your customs form and you will end up paying much higher customs fees.<br><br>ANY QUESTIONS, ALWAYS, message me BEFORE purchasing the crystal. NOT AFTER.<br><br>Next... Providing your item is actually lost! Didn't happen to me yet but... it is possible. I can only file a claim 25 working days after the due delivery date (a vague date that is never fixed by our postal services). The shipping company only refunds SOME money! I will obviously credit you what they refund me. Nothing MORE! (express service is an exception, plus if you are paying extra for insurance).<br><br>I am always happy to help you, providing you are willing to make your crystals' journey safer and contribute a small effort towards your crystals safest arrival. I love my crystals SOOOOOO MUCH! It hurts me if you don't show any appreciation for their huge effort to find their way to you!<br>You may think you chose the crystal... but I often find that the crystals are the ones that are calling out to you 💕<br><br><br>💫 ESTIMATED ARRIVAL DATE 💫<br><br>PLEASE see your estimated arrival date before purchasing! I often ship the crystals within 1-3 working days. However now that I am back to working with my clients face-to-face, my travelling schedule resumed and I may delay shipping depending on my travelling schedule. I ALWAYS UPDATE my delivery settings. The estimated arrival date for my crystals is more or less accurate.<br><br>Should you need a crystal SUPER URGENTLY - message me. If I can despatch the same or the next day - I'll DO THAT.<br><br><br>💫 PACKAGING 💫<br><br>In this World of ♻️ packaging materials. <br>I recycle as MUCH as possible! Each piece of bubble wrap has been pre-used before (with love and care)... several times! ... so please be aware of this and know that I DO need to pack the crystals securely to make sure that your beautiful crystal friend (or friends) gets to you in one piece.<br><br>Would you rather I purchase more packaging materials at extra cost to our environment? Or would you rather allow me to reuse the bubble wrap and plastic packaging material that is still of good quality and in a perfectly usable condition?<br><br>Equally I try to reuse packaging paper if I get any and I will not buy new paper as it is equally cruel to our environment.<br><br>If you still prefer 'no plastic' policy there is now an option where you can purchase a new ADD-ON shipping option 'Wrap My Crystals In Towels' for an additional cost of £10,- to cover the costs of the towels that are brand new and purchased purely for this purpose. <br>Then I'll wrap the crystals in Wash cloths (cotton or microfibre) and I just may need to use a bit of sellotape (or else) and obviously the packaging tape.<br>Should you go for 'Wrap My Crystals In Towels' option, please take EXTRA CARE when unwrapping the crystals 🙌💎<br>Please bare in mind that option isn't suitable for fragile crystals.<br><br>ALSO! I use cute or silly stickers on the boxes! Sometimes I just need my kid to feel like she is helping me... But the main reason for that is that I don't want to draw 'wrong' attention to your package. There is a reason to this 'madness'.<br>If there is a problem with that and you need PLAIN PACKAGING - please let me know.<br><br>In short, if the box you receive from me looks really weird or funny - I promise there is a reason for that. Mainly security. And... something else, but I can explain that once you become my regular customer. (it is for safety of the crystals).<br><br><br>💫 PHOTOGRAPHY 💫<br><br>The crystal colour, or even the crystal itself, may look slightly different upon arrival compare to the colours/photos you see here on Etsy. That is due to the fact I often use a very bright day light to expose all the quirks the crystal may have. And of course the obvious fact that online images are always not-100%-accurate colour-wise.<br>Simply take your crystal to a very bright lamp and you'll see the crystal will open up to you as well ... and you may even see the very same colours that I've captured with my photography :)<br><br><br>💫 ADD ME TO YOUR FAVOURITE SHOPS 💫<br><br>Please add me to your favourite shops to stay up to date with my crystal adventures and my own spiritual journey 🙏<br>Or follow me on Instagram:<br>@byolgastar_crystals<br><br>Or Watch My YouTube Channel @byolgastar -<br>https://www.youtube.com/@byolgastar<br><br>Love and light,<br>Olga Star x<br><br><br>💫 ADDITIONAL RESOURCES 💫 <br><br>Individualised Human Consciousness Retrieval.

There is no need for such info to float about.I now try my best to include the crystal's description with the crystal itself (can't always guarantee).I still highly recommend you SAVING THE DESCRIPTION as I delete it the minute I ship the crystal to its new home...And remember the crystal healing information provided here is for your guidance only. It is not intended as a substitute for medical advice or service.3) WHO ARE STARSEEDS?I have a listing explaining just that:https://www.etsy.com/uk/listing/728176889/who-are-starseeds-by-olga-star-resourcesYou do not have to purchase the listing, simply read the description.Otherwise please watch my YouTube Video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFj_-Zv-OZg (please copy and paste the link into your browser)4) I AM HIGHLY SENSITIVE EMPATH, CAN YOU HELP?Most of my clients are highly sensitive aware and awakened/awakening empaths. I have a large selection of crystals that are the best suited for highly sensitive empaths as well as info/support listing:https://www.etsy.com/uk/listing/1542978223/highly-sensitive-empath-purpose-andand for crystals:https://www.etsy.com/uk/shop/byOlgaStar?search_query=empath💫 SHIPPING 💫All crystals are shipped 'tracked' as a 'small package' and usually in a carton box. This is to ensure their safe journey, which means there is always extra space for more crystals to fit in, and you can add as many crystals as you like for that ONE FREE SHIPPING 'fee' only (with rare exceptions).Do treat yourself to an extra crystal or two :-) 💙PLEASE CONTACT ME if you require to arrange an INSURANCE or alternatively you may opt for an express service that is the safest I find when dealing with such precious crystals.Personally I highly recommend the express service that way we don't need to arrange any insurance as I find that's the safest and fastest way to deliver YOUR treasures to you.Need to be said... 🙈I ship everything TRACKED, even if you don't purchase (don't pay for) any additional shipping. The tracking number IS in your order.IF YOU DO NOT receive your package WITHIN 1(!) WEEK after I mark 'shipped' (no matter where in the world you are!), please go onto your local post office website and track your package. If at all possible, sign up for the shipping alerts.If you want to have your crystal insured, then you need to contact me to set up a custom shipping FEE as insurance costs A LOT EXTRA. Obviously if you insure up to a higher value than the price you have paid, that will have to be reflected on your customs form and you will end up paying much higher customs fees.ANY QUESTIONS, ALWAYS, message me BEFORE purchasing the crystal. NOT AFTER.Next... Providing your item is actually lost! Didn't happen to me yet but... it is possible. I can only file a claim 25 working days after the due delivery date (a vague date that is never fixed by our postal services). The shipping company only refunds SOME money! I will obviously credit you what they refund me. Nothing MORE! (express service is an exception, plus if you are paying extra for insurance).I am always happy to help you, providing you are willing to make your crystals' journey safer and contribute a small effort towards your crystals safest arrival. I love my crystals SOOOOOO MUCH! It hurts me if you don't show any appreciation for their huge effort to find their way to you!You may think you chose the crystal... but I often find that the crystals are the ones that are calling out to you 💕💫 ESTIMATED ARRIVAL DATE 💫PLEASE see your estimated arrival date before purchasing! I often ship the crystals within 1-3 working days. However now that I am back to working with my clients face-to-face, my travelling schedule resumed and I may delay shipping depending on my travelling schedule. I ALWAYS UPDATE my delivery settings. The estimated arrival date for my crystals is more or less accurate.Should you need a crystal SUPER URGENTLY - message me. If I can despatch the same or the next day - I'll DO THAT.💫 PACKAGING 💫In this World of ♻️ packaging materials. I recycle as MUCH as possible! Each piece of bubble wrap has been pre-used before (with love and care)... several times! ... so please be aware of this and know that I DO need to pack the crystals securely to make sure that your beautiful crystal friend (or friends) gets to you in one piece.Would you rather I purchase more packaging materials at extra cost to our environment? Or would you rather allow me to reuse the bubble wrap and plastic packaging material that is still of good quality and in a perfectly usable condition?Equally I try to reuse packaging paper if I get any and I will not buy new paper as it is equally cruel to our environment.If you still prefer 'no plastic' policy there is now an option where you can purchase a new ADD-ON shipping option 'Wrap My Crystals In Towels' for an additional cost of £10,- to cover the costs of the towels that are brand new and purchased purely for this purpose. Then I'll wrap the crystals in Wash cloths (cotton or microfibre) and I just may need to use a bit of sellotape (or else) and obviously the packaging tape.Should you go for 'Wrap My Crystals In Towels' option, please take EXTRA CARE when unwrapping the crystals 🙌💎Please bare in mind that option isn't suitable for fragile crystals.ALSO! I use cute or silly stickers on the boxes! Sometimes I just need my kid to feel like she is helping me... But the main reason for that is that I don't want to draw 'wrong' attention to your package. There is a reason to this 'madness'.If there is a problem with that and you need PLAIN PACKAGING - please let me know.In short, if the box you receive from me looks really weird or funny - I promise there is a reason for that. Mainly security. And... something else, but I can explain that once you become my regular customer. (it is for safety of the crystals).💫 PHOTOGRAPHY 💫The crystal colour, or even the crystal itself, may look slightly different upon arrival compare to the colours/photos you see here on Etsy. That is due to the fact I often use a very bright day light to expose all the quirks the crystal may have. And of course the obvious fact that online images are always not-100%-accurate colour-wise.Simply take your crystal to a very bright lamp and you'll see the crystal will open up to you as well ... and you may even see the very same colours that I've captured with my photography :)💫 ADD ME TO YOUR FAVOURITE SHOPS 💫Please add me to your favourite shops to stay up to date with my crystal adventures and my own spiritual journey 🙏Or follow me on Instagram:@byolgastar_crystalsOr Watch My YouTube Channel @byolgastar -https://www.youtube.com/@byolgastarLove and light,Olga Star x💫 ADDITIONAL RESOURCES 💫 Individualised Human Consciousness Retrieval.

You can work with them straight away if you feel the crystals are eager to get going!I do 'seal' their energies for the duration of their travel, so most of the crystals you acquire from me should be arriving ready to work :)You are welcome to give them a gentle wash (no soap and no salt!) with plain water and only if the listing doesn't state: NO WATER (I have those as well) and then let them dry naturally. You may put them in the sun but for no longer then 5/15 mins as some crystals change colour in the sun or even loose it :( No smudging or anything of such sorts required. You can perform it as your own and habitual bonding experience should you absolute unable to control your urge of doing something to the crystals 🙈😛 ... Just saying! ❤️OR! if you have other rituals in store for the new crystals arriving to your very own Crystal Kingdom.2) IS THE INFORMATION/DESCRIPTION AVAILABLE AFTER I COMPLETE THE PURCHASE?Once a crystal is 'sold', the information gets deleted. I often have very crystal-specific information within my listings. Meaning that the information is only relevant to that very specific crystal. There is no need for such info to float about.I now try my best to include the crystal's description with the crystal itself (can't always guarantee).I still highly recommend you SAVING THE DESCRIPTION as I delete it the minute I ship the crystal to its new home...And remember the crystal healing information provided here is for your guidance only. It is not intended as a substitute for medical advice or service.3) WHO ARE STARSEEDS?I have a listing explaining just that:https://www.etsy.com/uk/listing/728176889/who-are-starseeds-by-olga-star-resourcesYou do not have to purchase the listing, simply read the description.Otherwise please watch my YouTube Video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFj_-Zv-OZg (please copy and paste the link into your browser)4) I AM HIGHLY SENSITIVE EMPATH, CAN YOU HELP?Most of my clients are highly sensitive aware and awakened/awakening empaths. I have a large selection of crystals that are the best suited for highly sensitive empaths as well as info/support listing:https://www.etsy.com/uk/listing/1542978223/highly-sensitive-empath-purpose-andand for crystals:https://www.etsy.com/uk/shop/byOlgaStar?search_query=empath💫 SHIPPING 💫All crystals are shipped 'tracked' as a 'small package' and usually in a carton box. This is to ensure their safe journey, which means there is always extra space for more crystals to fit in, and you can add as many crystals as you like for that ONE FREE SHIPPING 'fee' only (with rare exceptions).Do treat yourself to an extra crystal or two :-) 💙PLEASE CONTACT ME if you require to arrange an INSURANCE or alternatively you may opt for an express service that is the safest I find when dealing with such precious crystals.Personally I highly recommend the express service that way we don't need to arrange any insurance as I find that's the safest and fastest way to deliver YOUR treasures to you.Need to be said... 🙈I ship everything TRACKED, even if you don't purchase (don't pay for) any additional shipping. The tracking number IS in your order.IF YOU DO NOT receive your package WITHIN 1(!) WEEK after I mark 'shipped' (no matter where in the world you are!), please go onto your local post office website and track your package. If at all possible, sign up for the shipping alerts.If you want to have your crystal insured, then you need to contact me to set up a custom shipping FEE as insurance costs A LOT EXTRA. Obviously if you insure up to a higher value than the price you have paid, that will have to be reflected on your customs form and you will end up paying much higher customs fees.ANY QUESTIONS, ALWAYS, message me BEFORE purchasing the crystal. NOT AFTER.Next... Providing your item is actually lost! Didn't happen to me yet but... it is possible. I can only file a claim 25 working days after the due delivery date (a vague date that is never fixed by our postal services). The shipping company only refunds SOME money! I will obviously credit you what they refund me. Nothing MORE! (express service is an exception, plus if you are paying extra for insurance).I am always happy to help you, providing you are willing to make your crystals' journey safer and contribute a small effort towards your crystals safest arrival. I love my crystals SOOOOOO MUCH! It hurts me if you don't show any appreciation for their huge effort to find their way to you!You may think you chose the crystal... but I often find that the crystals are the ones that are calling out to you 💕💫 ESTIMATED ARRIVAL DATE 💫PLEASE see your estimated arrival date before purchasing! I often ship the crystals within 1-3 working days. However now that I am back to working with my clients face-to-face, my travelling schedule resumed and I may delay shipping depending on my travelling schedule. I ALWAYS UPDATE my delivery settings. The estimated arrival date for my crystals is more or less accurate.Should you need a crystal SUPER URGENTLY - message me. If I can despatch the same or the next day - I'll DO THAT.💫 PACKAGING 💫In this World of ♻️ packaging materials. I recycle as MUCH as possible! Each piece of bubble wrap has been pre-used before (with love and care)... several times! ... so please be aware of this and know that I DO need to pack the crystals securely to make sure that your beautiful crystal friend (or friends) gets to you in one piece.Would you rather I purchase more packaging materials at extra cost to our environment? Or would you rather allow me to reuse the bubble wrap and plastic packaging material that is still of good quality and in a perfectly usable condition?Equally I try to reuse packaging paper if I get any and I will not buy new paper as it is equally cruel to our environment.If you still prefer 'no plastic' policy there is now an option where you can purchase a new ADD-ON shipping option 'Wrap My Crystals In Towels' for an additional cost of £10,- to cover the costs of the towels that are brand new and purchased purely for this purpose. Then I'll wrap the crystals in Wash cloths (cotton or microfibre) and I just may need to use a bit of sellotape (or else) and obviously the packaging tape.Should you go for 'Wrap My Crystals In Towels' option, please take EXTRA CARE when unwrapping the crystals 🙌💎Please bare in mind that option isn't suitable for fragile crystals.ALSO! I use cute or silly stickers on the boxes! Sometimes I just need my kid to feel like she is helping me... But the main reason for that is that I don't want to draw 'wrong' attention to your package. There is a reason to this 'madness'.If there is a problem with that and you need PLAIN PACKAGING - please let me know.In short, if the box you receive from me looks really weird or funny - I promise there is a reason for that. Mainly security. And... something else, but I can explain that once you become my regular customer. (it is for safety of the crystals).💫 PHOTOGRAPHY 💫The crystal colour, or even the crystal itself, may look slightly different upon arrival compare to the colours/photos you see here on Etsy. That is due to the fact I often use a very bright day light to expose all the quirks the crystal may have. And of course the obvious fact that online images are always not-100%-accurate colour-wise.Simply take your crystal to a very bright lamp and you'll see the crystal will open up to you as well ... and you may even see the very same colours that I've captured with my photography :)💫 ADD ME TO YOUR FAVOURITE SHOPS 💫Please add me to your favourite shops to stay up to date with my crystal adventures and my own spiritual journey 🙏Or follow me on Instagram:@byolgastar_crystalsOr Watch My YouTube Channel @byolgastar -https://www.youtube.com/@byolgastarLove and light,Olga Star x💫 ADDITIONAL RESOURCES 💫 Individualised Human Consciousness Retrieval.

The silvery Shungite can be crossed by veins of chalcopyrite and inclusions of ocher-colored Jarosite. It is a fragile stone making it complex to cut.Warning:Lithotherapy falls within the framework of alternative energy therapies, it does not replace so-called modern medicine.

It can also be used to cleansing and charge your crystals, as well as display crystals and incense!<br><br>The listing is for the Selenite Crystal Incense Holder only .

There may be small variations in colors, patterns, sizes, and forms.Please keep in mind that this burner is designed to use with standard-size stick incense.This incense holder is created with stoneware clay, then glossed and fired at 1140° C in the ceramic kiln.↕ Height: 3.5 cm / 1,3""↕ Length: 18 cm / 7""↕ Width: 13.5 cm / 5,3""Note: This price is for an incense holder.",,"1590450064","https://i.etsystatic.com/31506754/r/il/d987e7/5864698978/il_794xN.5864698978_d265.jpg","https://i.etsystatic.com/31506754/r/il/cb2875/5564368751/il_1588xN.5564368751_bcea.jpg","https://i.etsystatic.com/31506754/r/il/88e2d0/5564368455/il_1588xN.5564368455_3f7q.jpg","https://i.etsystatic.com/31506754/r/il/aaa8a0/5564368515/il_1588xN.5564368515_dqrz.jpg","https://i.etsystatic.com/31506754/r/il/8fdfd0/5564368619/il_1588xN.5564368619_6v7d.jpg","https://i.etsystatic.com/31506754/r/il/91dc66/5564368687/il_1588xN.5564368687_7xt5.jpg","https://i.etsystatic.com/31506754/r/il/228c88/5516251916/il_1588xN.5516251916_mbwg.jpg","https://i.etsystatic.com/31506754/r/il/e09e18/5564369087/il_1588xN.5564369087_giii.jpg","https://i.etsystatic.com/31506754/r/il/6058c5/5564369215/il_1588xN.5564369215_n874.jpg",,"20 May, 2024","Gray Stick Incense Holder, Meditation Gift, Stoneware Stick Incense, Handmade Incense, Ceramic Incense Burner, Concrete Color Incense Holder","5","https://www.etsy.com/ca/market/incense_stick?ref=lp_queries_internal_bottom-1","Incense Stick","https://www.etsy.com/ca/market/ceramic_incense?ref=lp_queries_internal_bottom-2","Ceramic Incense","https://www.etsy.com/ca/market/yoga_gift?ref=lp_queries_internal_bottom-3","Yoga Gift","https://www.etsy.com/ca/market/meditation_gift?ref=lp_queries_internal_bottom-4","Meditation Gift","https://www.etsy.com/ca/market/home_fragrance?ref=lp_queries_internal_bottom-5","Home Fragrance","https://www.etsy.com/ca/market/incense_ash_catcher?ref=lp_queries_internal_bottom-6","Incense Ash Catcher","https://www.etsy.com/ca/market/incense_stick_burner?ref=lp_queries_internal_bottom-7","Incense Stick Burner","https://www.etsy.com/ca/market/incense_burner?ref=lp_queries_internal_bottom-8","Incense Burner","https://www.etsy.com/ca/market/handmade_incense?ref=lp_queries_internal_bottom-9","Handmade Incense","https://www.etsy.com/ca/market/concrete_color?ref=lp_queries_internal_bottom-10","Concrete Color","https://www.etsy.com/ca/market/concrete_incense?ref=lp_queries_internal_bottom-11","Concrete Incense",,,,,"SiestaStudioShop","272","4.8851","https://www.etsy.com/ca/shop/SiestaStudioShop?ref=shop-header-name&listing_id=1590450064&from_page=listing","","","","","https://www.etsy.com/ca/listing/1590450064/gray-stick-incense-holder-meditation?click_key=7fa7bf41272bf1e271abef2e257744007558212a%3A1590450064&click_sum=a50404b3&ga_order=most_relevant&ga_search_type=all&ga_view_type=gallery&ga_search_query=incense+holder&ref=sc_gallery-2-4&pro=1&sts=1&ret=1",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of the strings has the dorje at the end, and the other the bell. Where these strings are placed on the mala is totally up to you. Tibetans usually have theirs after the 6th bead on either side of the guru bead, but that is for no special reason and you can put them wherever you like.<br><br>We use the dorje counter to keep count of each circuit of 100 that we make on the mala. So each time you finish one circuit, you will pull forward one bead on the dorje counter to the top of the counter. After 10 circuits of the mala, you will have moved all 10 beads on your dorje counter, and you will have recited 1000 mantras. After that, you will move one bead forward to the top on the bell counter, to symbolize 1000 mantras counted. Then you begin again with a new circuit on your mala, and once you have made a new circuit, you move one of the dorje counter beads forward, and continue like this. With a dorje and bell counter, you can count up to 10,000 mantra recitations.<br><br>❤ABOUT US<br>We're artisans from Hepo Township, Baiyu County,Tibetan.

            *CRYSTALS INCLUDED* <br><br>***WE CANNOT PROVIDE USA OR EU TRACKING UNLESS YOU ASK FOR TRACKED POSTAGE - I WILL PROVIDE A QUOTE AND AGREE ADDITIONAL COST VIA MESSAGE WITH  YOU - INTERNATIONAL STANDARD IS NOT A TRACKED SERVICE***<br><br>It can be hard to manifest and practice the law of attraction to begin with, it is easy to forget our mantras, to be grateful and forget certain steps.<br><br>With this coin allow all of this knowledge and advice to be captured and represented in our special adaptation of your ’gratitude rock’. Allow the law of attraction to be manifested in its entirety in this small keepsake. Have this medallion on your person at all times - touch it - feel it - absorb its message - tap into it as the law of attraction tells us to tap into the universe’s power to unlock and unleash our full potential. <br><br>Designs and lettering included and what they represent:<br><br>The back of the coin has I AM prompts for when you need inspiration or a reminder. This is your mantra and should be what you turn to and repeat to yourself in line with ‘the law’:<br><br>I AM … <br>Wealth, health, happiness, focus, purpose, love, calm, strength, power, capable, joy, positivity, deserving, grateful, enough, free, blessed, infinite., confident, worthy, secure, beautiful, courage, present, growth, Abundance, Going to speak my will into existence. <br><br>You are and will do all of the above to be complete, content and fulfilled in your life and self.<br><br>On the rear of the coin we have the stars to remember the universe, -  that which binds us and connects us and allows the law of attraction to unleash is power and potential onto you; remember you are part of it and it will align in your favour. The large central symbol to the front of the coin is the Cho Ku Rei. This symbol is what gives the talisman its power. Cho Ku Rei is of Japanese origin and loosely translates to ‘place all the powers of the universe here’, it was originally used by ancient reiki masters to help them channel the universe’s energy, boosting and concentrating it to use it for their desired purpose. So too will its presence on this coin help channel the universe’s energy to you. <br>The two sets of 11’s on the coin face also have a significant, spiritual presence. It is considered the master number that can combine great energies unlocking great power, enlightenment, spiritual awakening and a signals that your life’s actions are aligning and combining with your soul’s higher purpose.

Your thoughts are magnets - only think what you want to attract back.<br><br>3. The Law of Unwavering Desire<br>Be free of question, concern or doubt. An element of stability is required for manifestation of desires to occur - be sure and confident should you want whatever achievements or goals you desire to transpire. You must be kind to and faith in yourself. <br><br>4. The Law of Delicate Balance<br>Think of the universe and life itself as a perfect and delicate scale. For success, harmony and sustainability the two sides must be balances, always. If one side tips you sacrifice the other and visa versa. Remember this and apply to your own actions, be grateful and enjoy what is at present or the middle point of your scale but also when striving to improve and achieve don’t become rash, impulsive or excessive in your exploits (tipping one end of the scale) nor should you neglect other things like what you have or have had allowing yourself to become complacent. <br><br>5. The Law of Harmony<br>Everything in the universe is connected and, therefore, in perpetual harmony and balance, all things feeding into one another infinitely. If you situate yourself in alignment with the universe and all its boundless connections you can tap into this infinite and immense source of energy that will then flow through you - it is then that your full potential and full influential power can be harnessed and used to benefit your life. <br><br>6. The Law of Right Action<br>Circumstances in life are unpredictable and will test you daily. A choice is required of you constantly - the right or wrong course of action. how you react to a positive or negative experience will directly impact not only yourself but those around you also. A simple choice, a switch you flick will determine the energy and events that manifest in your life, so choose wisely. Treat others how you wish to be treated and the same logic will apply to all.<br><br>7. The Law of Universal Influence<br>Everyone is connected by way of the law of harmony above. think about this you are connected to another person who is connected to another and so on - weather you are near the beginning middle or end of this chain you indefinitely have an effect on someone else. If you exude positive emotions and conducted yourself in a corresponding manner so too will the person/person you are connected with, and in return many other may act this way to have an unknowing positive effect on you and your life. Treat others how you wish to be treated and the same logic will apply to all. <br><br>Please note this listing is for the coin only.

Have this medallion on your person at all times - touch it - feel it - absorb its message - tap into it as the law of attraction tells us to tap into the universe’s power to unlock and unleash our full potential. Designs and lettering included and what they represent:The back of the coin has I AM prompts for when you need inspiration or a reminder.

The large central symbol to the front of the coin is the Cho Ku Rei. This symbol is what gives the talisman its power. Cho Ku Rei is of Japanese origin and loosely translates to ‘place all the powers of the universe here’, it was originally used by ancient reiki masters to help them channel the universe’s energy, boosting and concentrating it to use it for their desired purpose. So too will its presence on this coin help channel the universe’s energy to you. The two sets of 11’s on the coin face also have a significant, spiritual presence. It is considered the master number that can combine great energies unlocking great power, enlightenment, spiritual awakening and a signals that your life’s actions are aligning and combining with your soul’s higher purpose.

We are now exposed to 100 million times the amount of EMF/EMR as compared to our grandparents. There are numerous studies and coverage available on the Internet on this growing but unstoppable menace to mankind. Fortunately for mankind, QBP'S Scalar Energy Quantum Shield has the ability to protect humans from these harmful EMF/EMR. This revolutionary Quantum Shield offers the most advanced technology to address stress where you live, work and play. Its universal application means the same Quantum Shield can be applied on all your electronic tech-gadgets (wired or wireless), household appliances, etc. - all of which emit various levels of electromagnetic fields (EMF) or electromagnetic radiation (EMR). Research has shown prolonged and repeated exposure to aggressive EMF and EMR causes a measurable stress response and negative shifts in the body's key energetic systems. QBP's Quantum Shield can be used on any appliance or device emitting electromagnetic frequencies (EMF) or electromagnetic radiation (EMR), such as mobile phones, home phones, cars, microwaves, computers, game consoles, home appliances, etc. If it plugs and plays on DC or AC currents, protect it with Quantum Shield. Quantum Shield ""simply"" blocks a large percentage of EMF or EMR that comes through it and it really works! Some appliances may only need 1 Quantum Shield, others may need 2, 3 or more depending on the nature of the device.

            Hi Lovely Souls xx As you know I work from a place of complete unconditional love 💖<br>However, whether we choose to recognize them or not, negative entities exist. <br>These entities exist in the lower spiritual frequency densities of reality and are attracted to certain kinds of thought-forms and mental and emotional energies. <br><br>💖Most people are unable to see them, however, their effects can be felt in subtle ways and can even cause physical health problems such as psychosis or schizophrenia. <br><br>💖People with natural psychic or clairvoyant abilities, shamans, spiritual healers, or those who have gone through a spiritual awakening or Reiki attunement, are more likely to be able to perceive them. This is because an attunement or spiritual awakening enables a person to access more subtle frequencies, which allows them to see, hear, feel, and perceive things that are usually hidden from most people.<br><br>💖It's possible for a negative presence to attach itself to an individual due to the frequency in which they vibrate and the attitude they possess at that particular time. Additionally, these entities may also enter the body through spiritual or psychic interaction during dreams, meditations, psychic-states, or any number of out of body spiritual experiences while travelling the astral plane. For instance, if a person holds a highly negative demeanor, such as having vices or sexual perversions, they will attract negative entities to them due to the frequency compatibility, allowing them to immediately penetrate the person's aura.<br><br>💖In certain cases, the dreamer may experience an unfamiliar dreamscape or series of events involving unfamiliar characters. These dream figures may have distinguishing characteristics that can help to identify their purpose or intentions - be it positive or negative. Depending on the interaction and the energy that has been exchanged, the dreamer's spiritual body may be left with a contamination of negative energy, which then transfers back into the body and affects the mental-ego.<br><br>💜Do you feel that something sinister has taken control of you and you are unable to shake it off? Would you like to be rid of any negative entities, evil spirits, entity attachments, and demons that may be causing you harm? I can help you with powerful distance healing to remove these negative influences from your body using Reiki and other powerful spiritual healing techniques.<br><br>💜Negative entities can cause spiritual, emotional, physical and mental suffering, such as stress, anxiety, grief, and heartbreak. Therefore, it is important to eliminate them as soon as possible. This healing session will be conducted remotely, but it is just as effective as an in-person healing. <br><br>💜How can I tell if I am being affected by Negative Entities? <br>Signs include: a dense and heavy energy, damaged electronics and appliances, frequent sickness in pets or you, increased conflict in relationships, failed plans and projects, feelings of discouragement and fear, strange dreams, and difficulty sleeping. - These are just some of the symptoms.<br><br>💜🤍💜Signs of Possession, Exorcism, Attachment from Evil Spirits and Negative Entities: If you are not recovering from any of the following symptoms through medical attention, it is probable that negative entities are the culprits.

It is an ancient mystical process for creating protection against evil and negative powers so that positive spiritual energies can take hold and to expedite the process of fulfilling your WISHES and DESIRES. This kavach gives the direct personal blessing of Lord Shiva Laxmi Devi and Lord Kuber for all of your financial needs. This kavach is entirely personalized and requires the full name given at birth of the wearer, the nakshatra and gotra (if know) and the current city and state of the person. The priest will require 3 days to create and energize your kavach after payment. Once begun, the name can not be changed. Please make sure that you give the NAME AT BIRTH (not a diksha or married name) correctly. This information is placed in the sankalpa (like a statement of intent) while the initial rites are taking place, during the puja and daily when the mantras are chanted. This fully links the Divine Energy with you. The kavach is good for a lifetime and will never needed cleansed or re-energized. Our Laxmi Kuber Kavach acts as a spiritual shield protecting you from financial loss, instability and poverty. It allows the pure blessings of the devic realms to surround you and attract massive amounts of money, accumulates wealth, provides stability and material comforts. It places one in the most advantageous positions for luck and advancement. For business people, you shall attract more clients/customers and attain new levels of success. It makes one open for promotions, unexpected sources of sudden income and makes you more fortunate at games of chance. Your all around ability to attract money, wealth and success will increase. It is a must for anyone in this age when misfortune and setbacks can come at any time. Kuber is the god of wealth and the god’s treasurer. Kuber is the actual Lord of Riches in the Hindu pantheon (Laxmi being the goddess of fortune of which money is a great part). Wearing this kavach on a regular basis brings about a distinct change in one’s prosperity and luck though, of course, effort remains paramount. This is an extremely powerful and rare kavach. The owner of the kavach will never be lacking money and material comforts. The home and bank accounts will always be full and the entire family will never have shortages of resources. It blesses the owner with money and prosperity by drawing new avenues and sources of income and wealth. It helps increase the flow of funds and the ability to accumulate wealth. Substantial knowledge, time and work goes into each kavach. The priest first draws 24 small Kuber yantras on bhojpatra over 3 hours. This is a tantric formula using the most sacred number of Lord Kuber which is 72. These yantras are then, one at a time, offered with mantra into a small homa along with 108 names of Lord Kuber. The ash is then placed in the kavach. This gives your the power of the yantras, mantras and fire. The priest then purifies and energized a genuine gem with Laxmi Kuber mantras and places in the kavach. An additional secret holy items goes in and the kavach is sealed. Only then, does the priest perform the pratishta (life giving) and begins chanting the 10,000 required mantras.

            Gorgeous Crystallized Celestite Cluster and Moonstone Necklace<br>The pendant is made out of durable clay. It comes with light gray adjustable suede leather. <br>Please see all the pictures to understand better the size.<br><br>The pendant is made with durable clay, but not unbreakable. You can wear the pendant freely but it would be good to avoid the contact with water. A little water will not harm it so don't worry if it gets wet sometimes.<br><br>~Celestite~<br>This stone offers soft vibrations that stimulate the higher chakra systems. The Third Eye, Crown and Etheric chakras begin to slowly turn in a clockwise fashion, bringing us to higher states of awareness at a manageable pace. Unlike other high energy stones that send us on a blast toward higher frequencies, Celestite allows us to float at a softer pace toward higher vibrational awareness. Celestite is extremely beneficial for healing the aura and is able to preserve a peaceful atmosphere. This is especially helpful in times of stress or chaos as it will open those around it to remain calm and develop greater trust in the wisdom of the Divine.

        ","Gorgeous Crystallized Celestite Cluster and Moonstone NecklaceThe pendant is made out of durable clay. It comes with light gray adjustable suede leather. Please see all the pictures to understand better the size.The pendant is made with durable clay, but not unbreakable. You can wear the pendant freely but it would be good to avoid the contact with water. A little water will not harm it so don't worry if it gets wet sometimes.~Celestite~This stone offers soft vibrations that stimulate the higher chakra systems. The Third Eye, Crown and Etheric chakras begin to slowly turn in a clockwise fashion, bringing us to higher states of awareness at a manageable pace. Unlike other high energy stones that send us on a blast toward higher frequencies, Celestite allows us to float at a softer pace toward higher vibrational awareness. Celestite is extremely beneficial for healing the aura and is able to preserve a peaceful atmosphere. This is especially helpful in times of stress or chaos as it will open those around it to remain calm and develop greater trust in the wisdom of the Divine. It helps to find and maintain purity of the heart so that one may speak and act in accordance with their heart’s purest intentions. ~Moonstone~ Moonstone is foremost a talisman of the inward journey, taking one deep into the self to retrieve what is missing, the parts of the soul left behind or forgotten, then brought to light.

The names “Meditation Beads”, “Yoga Beads”, “Mala Necklace” also refer to the same thing. <br><br>A Mala is a string of 108 beads used for meditation, reflection, prayer or yoga practice.  It is a support helping count mantras during meditation in sets of 108. It can also be used to cleanse the chakra system and for crystal healing. Or it can simply be enjoyed and worn by anyone as a piece of jewellery.<br><br>Malas have been present for centuries, the most ancient references dating from 8th century BCE.

The Third Eye, Crown and Etheric chakras begin to slowly turn in a clockwise fashion, bringing us to higher states of awareness at a manageable pace. Unlike other high energy stones that send us on a blast toward higher frequencies, Celestite allows us to float at a softer pace toward higher vibrational awareness. Celestite is extremely beneficial for healing the aura and is able to preserve a peaceful atmosphere. This is especially helpful in times of stress or chaos as it will open those around it to remain calm and develop greater trust in the wisdom of the Divine.

Our ties to the moon are strong. As it waxes and wanes in cyclic perfection, it creates the tides and rhythms of our mother, Earth, and influences our behaviors, emotions and spiritual growth. Moonstone calms and encourages, teaching us the natural rhythms of life.Moonstones have an association with the Crown Chakra and our spiritual center.

            Welcome, Namaste <br>AMETHYST MALA 108 + 1 BEADS ROSARY<br><br>NUMBER OF BEADS - 108 + 1<br><br> SIZE OF BEADS : 8 MM(APPROX)<br><br>LENGTH OF MALA : 90 CM (APPROX)<br><br>Buddhists and Hindus both use prayer beads. In Hinduism they are more commonly known as Japa, and in Buddhism they are more commonly known as Mala. There are usually 108 beads and a top bead known as the Guru Bead or Sumeru. Smaller numbers of beads can also be used and are usually known as Wrist Mala or Power Bead Bracelets because they are worn around the wrist, which is useful if you are travelling.<br><br>Mala or Japa beads aid concentration when meditating. The Beads are usually held and moved between the thumb and third finger until the mantras have been completed. When you reach the Guru Bead or Sumeru, you turn the beads around and go back the other way, rather than crossing over the top bead. The index finger never touches the beads because it represents Ego, which is an impediment to self-realization.<br><br>Why 108 beads?

        ","Welcome, Namaste AMETHYST MALA 108 + 1 BEADS ROSARYNUMBER OF BEADS - 108 + 1 SIZE OF BEADS : 8 MM(APPROX)LENGTH OF MALA : 90 CM (APPROX)Buddhists and Hindus both use prayer beads. In Hinduism they are more commonly known as Japa, and in Buddhism they are more commonly known as Mala. There are usually 108 beads and a top bead known as the Guru Bead or Sumeru. Smaller numbers of beads can also be used and are usually known as Wrist Mala or Power Bead Bracelets because they are worn around the wrist, which is useful if you are travelling.Mala or Japa beads aid concentration when meditating. The Beads are usually held and moved between the thumb and third finger until the mantras have been completed. When you reach the Guru Bead or Sumeru, you turn the beads around and go back the other way, rather than crossing over the top bead. The index finger never touches the beads because it represents Ego, which is an impediment to self-realization.Why 108 beads? There are many reasons – 108 is a sacred number to the Eastern religions and traditions.AMETHYST is one of the most spiritual stones, connecting with Divine forces, it opens intuition and enhances psychic gifts.

Counting with Dorje and Bell When counting very large numbers of mantra recitations, it is helpful to have some additional counters attached to your malas. One of the strings has the dorje at the end, and the other the bell. Where these strings are placed on the mala is totally up to you. Tibetans usually have theirs after the 6th bead on either side of the guru bead, but that is for no special reason and you can put them wherever you like.<br><br>We use the dorje counter to keep count of each circuit of 100 that we make on the mala. So each time you finish one circuit, you will pull forward one bead on the dorje counter to the top of the counter. After 10 circuits of the mala, you will have moved all 10 beads on your dorje counter, and you will have recited 1000 mantras. After that, you will move one bead forward to the top on the bell counter, to symbolize 1000 mantras counted. Then you begin again with a new circuit on your mala, and once you have made a new circuit, you move one of the dorje counter beads forward, and continue like this.

Great for use in Reiki and Crystal Healing. Choose the perfect size to fit your needs!<br><br>Your crystals, pendulums, stones should be cleansed and recharged on a regular basis – especially if you work with them often. This charging bowl is perfect for this purpose. Selenite is ideal for all types of energy cleansing. It has the ability to quickly unblock 'stuck' energy and completely remove negative energy. Selenite also greatly magnifies the energy of anything that is placed upon them. You can set anything you like in these charging bowls to cleanse and recharge them.

This can give the appearance of damage or 'cracks' - it is not - it is very normal for selenite. Due to its soft nature the outer rims of bowls can also show these 'cracks' or 'veins' and the edge can also look a little uneven with minor 'nicks' and 'scratches' - again it is normal for selenite. Selenite can have minor inclusions so the odd speck, dark mark or minor discoloration may be visible.

            Hand-knotted 108-Bead Sacred Tulsi Wood Hand-Carved Rough Beads Japa Mala<br><br>⩥Materials Used:  Rough Tulsi wood, Tulsi Tulasi, Wax/Parachhute Tassel<br>⩥Guru Bead: Hand-Carved Radha Named Guru Bead<br>⩥Length: 18-20 inches <br>⩥Tassel: Sparkling Brown<br><br>ↈThese beautiful Natural Tulsi Beads mala's Guru bead is carved with Radha Named and hand-knotted Sparkling Brown thread to add longevity and comfort during meditation and yoga. You never see this unbreakable quality of knots.<br>ↈOur Tulsi beads are made by the best craftsmen in the ancient tradition and are naturally polished with beeswax. They are never artificially dyed.  We obtain an array of shades of brown through immersion in natural Desi Ghee.<br><br>⩥About this Mala<br>""Japa"" refers to the meditative repetition of a mantra or the name of a deity.  In Sanskrit, ""Japa"" literally means ""muttering"" or ""mumbling"", but in spiritual practice, we use it to talk about a sacred sound, word, or phrase as a form of meditation. <br><br>""Mala"" refers to the garland of prayer beads used to count mantra repetitions - hence ""Japa Mala"" - freeing the mind from the counting to focus on the mantra itself.

A double Dorje represents the foundation of the physical world and is also associated with certain tantric deities.<br><br>In Buddhism, the vajra is the symbol of Vajrayana, one of the three major schools of Buddhism. Vajrayana is translated as ""Thunderbolt Way"" or ""Diamond Way"" and can imply the thunderbolt experience of Buddhist enlightenment or bodhi. It also implies indestructibility,just as diamonds are harder than other gemstones.<br><br>In Tantric Buddhism (Vajrayana) the vajra and tribu (bell)are used in many rites by a lama or any Vajrayana practitioner of sadhana. The vajra is a male polysemic symbol that represents many things for the tantrika. The vajra is representative of upaya (skilful means) whereas its companion tool, the bell which is a female symbol, denotes prajna (wisdom). Some deities are shown holding each the vajra and bell in separate hands, symbolizing the union of the forces of compassion and wisdom, respectively.<br><br>Vajrasattva holds the vajra in his right hand and a bell in his left hand.<br>In the tantric traditions of Buddhism, the vajra is a symbol for the nature of reality, or sunyata, indicating endless creativity, potency, and skillful activity. The term is employed extensively in tantric literature: the term for the spiritual teacher is the vajracharya; one of the five dhyani buddhas is vajrasattva, and so on. The practice of prefixing terms, names, places, and so on by vajra represents the conscious attempt to recognize the transcendental aspect of all phenomena; it became part of the process of ""sacramentalizing"" the activities of the spiritual practitioner and encouraged him to engage all his psychophysical energies in the spiritual life.<br><br>An instrument symbolizing vajra is also extensively used in the rituals of the tantra. It consists of a spherical central section, with two symmetrical sets of five prongs, which arc out from lotus blooms on either side of the sphere and come to a point at two points equidistant from the centre, thus giving it the appearance of a ""diamond sceptre"", which is how the term is sometimes translated.<br><br>Various figures in Tantric iconography are represented holding or wielding the vajra. Three of the most famous of these are Vajrasattva,Vajrapani, and Padmasambhava. Vajrasattva (lit. vajra-being) holds the vajra, in his right hand, to his heart. The figure of the Wrathful Vajrapani (lit. vajra in the hand) brandishes the vajra, in his right hand, above his head. Padmasambhava holds the vajra above his right knee in his right hand.<br><br>❤ABOUT Thokcha -Thunder Iron<br>Thokcha (Tibetan: ཐོག་ལྕགས, གནམ་ལྕགས) are tektites and meteorites which serve as amulets.Typically high in iron content, also called Thunder Iron,Cold Iron.These are traditionally believed to contain a magical, protective power comparable to Tibetan dzi beads.
